My quantum challenges for QubitbyQubit final project
Read me: Quantum Coding Challenge
QXQ Coding Challenge Description

Please note: this is only for those that wish to complete the Quantum Coding Challenge as their final project. Notebooks can be accessed in this module. 

 

While the specific topics for the Quantum Art and Deep Dive Projects are completely open, we will be providing 3 Coding Challenge notebooks each covering a different topic. To help you decide which topic you would like to focus on, we have provided some initial details below. As a reminder, the notebooks will be released on March 20th, 2023. 


There will be 3 levels of notebooks provided. They are all graded with the same weight (you will not be penalized for choosing the Beginner notebook or rewarded for choosing the Advanced notebook). Below, you can find the general topic and some key technical criteria that may weigh into your decision:


Beginner: New Error Correction Scheme

This will involve:

Parts of the Bit and Phase Flip codes explored during Week 21.
Combining multiple circuits in Qiskit.
Measuring how close quantum states are to each other.
 

Intermediate: New Quantum Key Distribution Protocol

This will involve:

New single qubit gates.
Measuring how entangled a quantum state is.
Running the protocol with a simulator and real hardware.
 

Advanced: Grover’s Algorithm Applied to a New Problem

This will involve:

New multi qubit gates.
Learning how to use Grover’s to search through a list of solutions to a problem.
A small amount of guided research into graph problems.
